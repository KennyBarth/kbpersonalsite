# kbpersonalsite
Hello!  This is my repository for my inf286 final project. 
I've made a personal website and uploaded all the HTML, CSS and images - just download and extract the files and launch "kbarthmain.html" from the Code folder.
I hope you like the site, I've put a lot of work into this project and have enjoyed this learning experience a lot!
